<h4 align="center">An Age-Verification-Gate Plugin for Craft CMS</h4>

<br>

## Overview

This plugin provides a simple way to add an age-verification-gate to your website, where the user has to verify their age.  
This happens on a nice looking page that you can customize however you want!  
The plugin also features a lot of different ways the user can verify their age.  
Drop-Downs? Input Fields? Just some buttons? This plugin has everything.  
If you have adult-content, or content that is not intended to be seen by minors, this is the best and only plugin on the market right now!  
Just download and enjoy! :wink:
